\chapter*{ACKNOWLEDGEMENT}

Here I would like to thank all the individuals who provide your kind supports and assistances to me and finally make this dissertation possible. It is hard to use words to express my gratitude to all of you.

Foremost, I want to express my heartfelt thanks to my Ph.D supervisor Prof.Chengbin Ma. His wisdom, knowledge, and encouragement really make me to mature as a qualified researcher.
Without his guidance, it is hard for me to make all the accomplishments what I have already achieved. 

Moreover, I would like to express my gratitude to my dissertation committee members, Prof. Houjun Tang, Prof. Jigang Wu, Prof. Mian Li, and Prof. Xinen Zhu. Their detailed guidance and insightful comments are very helpful to further improve the quality of this dissertation and make it more solid, both in terms of technical contents and readability. Also, many thanks to Prof. Patrick Chi-Kwong LUK and Dr. Songnan Yang for their worthful guidance and advice on my research works, especially at the very beginning of my research.

And then, I am grateful to all my lab mates for their selfless helps. I am very enjoy the time working with them all. I also thank the JI staffs for your kind supports throughout my Ph.D program.

Finally, I want to give the special thanks to my family, especially my wife and my son. I will never forget the debt I owe you for your gratuitous support and understanding in the past three years. For this sake, I dedicate the dissertation to you.
